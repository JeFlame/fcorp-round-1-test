Due to some personal problems, I wasn't able to take the test until last Sunday but I've tried my best to do the test.
This is also the first time I've used Fastify and Elasticsearch so hope that you can give me some feedback to improve myself.

# User Guide:
1. Unzip file
2. Install package for client: `cd client` and `yarn install`
3. Install package for server: `cd api` and `yarn install`
4. Run code front-end: open a terminal and `cd client` and `yarn dev`
5. Run code back-end: open another terminal and `cd api` and `npx nodemon`
6. If you have any problems when running the source code, feel free to contact me at Gmail: hoangvu130301@gmail.com.
